        <p> The film follows Jon (Andrew Garfield), a young theater composer who's waiting tables at a New York City 
            diner in 1990 while writing what he hopes will be the next great American musical. Days before he's due 
            to showcase his work in a make-or-break performance, Jon is feeling the pressure from everywhere: from his 
            girlfriend Susan, who dreams of an artistic life beyond New York City; from his friend Michael, who has moved 
            on from his dream to a life of financial security; amidst an artistic community being ravaged by the AIDS epidemic. 
            With the clock ticking, Jon is at a crossroads and faces the question everyone must reckon with: What are we meant 
            to do with the time we have?</p>
