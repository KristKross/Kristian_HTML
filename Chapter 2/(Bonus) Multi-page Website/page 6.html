            <p>Although everyone knows and admires Andrew Garfield thanks to the big screen, especially Spider-Man, he 
               has always been a theater lover. Garfield becomes a giant in this movie, which combines the theater stage 
               he loves so much with the big screen. If Steven Levenson had watched it, he would have loved this movie 
               and Garfield.</p></div>

            <div id="border"><h3>tick, tick...BOOM!</h3>
            <p>9/10 - a criminally underrated musical is brought to life in this stunning adaptation that features 
               heartwrenching performances from Andrew Garfield, Alexandra Shipp, and Robin de Jes√∫s, a fantastic 
               soundtrack, and beautiful cinematography and craftsmanship.</p></div>

            <div id="border"><h3>Majestic</h3>
            <p>Majestic and wonderful biopic. The whole film has a pressing and motivated pace and manages to drag 
                you and make you feel very strong and wonderful emotions. The songs are beautiful and are cleverly 
                laid out in the film without ever being outlandish.</p>
